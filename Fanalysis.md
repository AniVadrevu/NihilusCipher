The nihilist cipher was useful when it was used in the 1880s because at the time, it was a complex cipher and it was difficult for others to find out. 

Prisoners were using it because of its complexity and it seemed to have no clear rhythm. It stopped being useful because when patterns were figured out, 
it was easy to decode, even by hand. 

It is similar to the Vigen√®re cipher, because they both do letter to number encryption. The cipher is definitely hard to crack, but it can be done, even by hand. Especially with modern technology, there's a good reason why this cipher has become obsolete
