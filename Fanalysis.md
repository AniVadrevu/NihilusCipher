> It was useful when it was used in the 1880s because at the time, it was a complex cipher and it was difficult for others to find out. 

> Prisoners were using it because of its complexity and it seemed to have no clear rhythm. It stopped being useful because when patterns were figured out, 
it was easy to decode, even by hand. 

> It is similar to the Vigen√®re cipher, because they both do letter to number encryption.
