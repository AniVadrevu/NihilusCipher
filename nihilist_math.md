## Mathematical Analysis

### How many possible keys or codes could there be? 
* 

### How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key? 
* 

### What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
* The math complexity for solving the code if you know the key is not difficult:
* After the ciphertext has been created and added to the plaintext numbers to the secret key numbers:
* The recipient, who knows the secret key, subtracts the secret key numbers from the ciphertext numbers. They receive the plaintext numbers, which can be changed into letters using the same table as the sender used for encryption, such as the following:
