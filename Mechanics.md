# Mechanics of the Nihilist Cypher
* How its works
  * First the encipherer constructs a Polybius square using a mixed alphabet. This is used to convert both the plaintext and a keyword to a series of two digit numbers.
  * Next These numbers are then added together in the normal way to get the ciphertext, with the key numbers repeated as required.
